Infertility is also defined as the failure to conceive after a year of regular intercourse without contraception according to modern science.

                            <h3>Causes of infertility</h3>
                            <hr />
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Infertility may be due to male or female factors. Causes of infertility in woman include ovarian factors, tubal factors, age-related factors, uterine problems, PCOS, endometriosis etc. 
                                        <br />
                                Male infertility is usually caused by problems that affect either sperm production or sperm transport which include varicocele, infections, ejaculation problems, tumours, hormone imbalances, defects of tubules that transport sperm etc.
                                        <br />
                                In Ayurveda main cause of any abnormal function in body is agnimandya (vitiation of the digestive fire of body) & tridosha dushti (vitiation of three governing factors of body).

                            <h3>Why is Ayurvedic Treatment beneficial ?</h3><hr />
                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                    Ayurveda supports health by strengthening body's own self-healing and balancing mechanisms and doesn't rely on intervention by any outside or foreign substance to replace or correct the hormones in the body. It focuses on the treatment of infertility holistically with an aim of improving the overall health and quality of life of the individual.
                                        <br />
                                    Infertility itself does not stand alone. It is the result of some other disease. So the herbs used in the treatment are directed towards eradicating the underlying cause. The most commonly known and used herbs such as Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), Shatavari (Asparagus racemousus), Amalaki (Emblica officinalis) are extremely useful formulations which help create the synergistic hormonal balance between the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and the Luteinizing Hormone (LH).<br />

                                    No individual herb alone is considered useful for promoting fertility. Therefore, a combination of herbs is used in the treatment of infertility with the purpose of correcting an organic or functional problem that causes infertility.
                                        <br />
